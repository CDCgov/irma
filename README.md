# IRMA - the Iterative Refinement Meta-Assembler

IRMA is a highly configurable next-generation sequencing assembly pipeline for virus genomes. Seed references are refined and edited as reads are matched, sorted, and aligned across virus genomes or gene segments. More information can be found on the [IRMA website](https://wonder.cdc.gov/amd/flu/irma/) or you can read the [manuscript]. If you use IRMA in a paper, please [cite](CITATION.bib) us.

## Usage

IRMA takes a `module`-`configuration` name, one or two fastq, and a project name. The project name can be a full path. For example:

```bash
Usage:
(PAIRED-END):   IRMA <MODULE|MODULE-CONFIG> <R1.fastq.gz|R1.fastq> <R2.fastq.gz|R2.fastq> [path/to/]<sample_name> [options]
(SINGLE-END):   IRMA <MODULE|MODULE-CONFIG> <fastq|fastq.gz> [path/to/]<sample_name> [options]

Options:
        --external-config|-c <VALID_CONFIG_PATH>
```

More usage information: <https://wonder.cdc.gov/amd/flu/irma/run.html>

## INSTALLATION & REQUIREMENTS

We recommend a multi-core machine with no fewer than 8 cores (16 or more threads work best) and at least 16 GB of RAM.  IRMA runtime is impacted by the number of cores available on a machine. In addition software requirements include:

- Perl 5.16
- R 3.6+
- BASH 3+
- Linux: RHEL 8+ or any recent Ubuntu like Bookworm
- *OR* macOS 10.14 on intel, macOS 11 on arm64 (Rosetta 2 required for LABEL)

### Via Archive

Download the latest archive via our [releases page](https://github.com/CDCgov/irma/releases). Use of `wget` or `curl` for downloads is *recommended for macOS to preserve functionality*.

1) Unzip the archive containing IRMA.
2) Move the package to your desired location and add the folder to your `PATH`
   - Note: IRMA_RES and IRMA must be in the same folder.
3) IRMA is now installed.  To test it from the package folder, execute:

   ```bash
   ./IRMA FLU tests/test2.fastq.gz test_project
   ```

### Via Docker

Simply run:

```bash
## From Github
docker run --rm -itv $(pwd):/data ghcr.io/cdcgov/irma:latest IRMA # more args

## From Dockerhub
docker run --rm -itv $(pwd):/data docker/cdcgov/irma:latest LABEL # more args
```

### Via MIRA

For a GUI interface, please visit [MIRA](https://github.com/CDCgov/MIRA). For usage with [nextflow](https://nextflow.io) consider [MIRA-NF](https://github.com/CDCgov/MIRA-NF). MIRA provides more end-to-end functionality out-of-the-box by integrating other components and providing extra summaries.

## Third Party Software

We aggregate and provide [builds of 3rd party software](IRMA_RES/third_party/) for execution at runtime with IRMA. Similarly, still more third-party software is [co-distributed with LABEL][label-codistribute] for runtime with IRMA. You may install or obtain your own copies and IRMA will detect them, but the user will be required to test for compatibility.

## Contributing

New feature integration is mainly being moved to the [irma-core](https://github.com/CDCgov/irma-core) project (support by [Zoe](https://github.com/CDCgov/zoe)), which is a mandatory component of IRMA as of v1.3.0. The IRMA repo itself will continue to address fixes needed for the Perl, R, and BASH code base, albeit some pieces may be obviated in future versions by IRMA-core. This repo will also continue to be responsible for data updates and other module artifacts and for the overall build and release.
